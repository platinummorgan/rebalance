# AI Development Context - Wealth Dial Project

## Project Overview
**Flutter 3.35.5** wealth management application with cross-platform support (Web/Mobile)
- **Primary Framework**: Flutter with Riverpod state management
- **Database**: Hive (object storage) with web compatibility via IndexedDB
- **Current Deployment**: Chrome web app running successfully
- **Architecture**: Feature-based structure with dashboard, accounts, liabilities modules

## Current Session Summary (September 30, 2025)

### Initial Request & Objectives
User requested **V1 polish for Compare snapshots feature** with three specific UI improvements:
1. **Step 1**: Fit preset buttons (Last Week, Last Month, Last Quarter, Last 6 months) on one line using abbreviations
2. **Step 2**: Change 'Close' button to obvious X icon  
3. **Step 3**: Fix non-functional save button

### Major Development Journey

#### Phase 1: QoL Feature Implementation (COMPLETED âœ…)
- **Snapshot Deletion**: Added comprehensive delete functionality with confirmation dialogs
- **Comparison Bookmarks System**: Complete implementation including:
  - `SavedComparison` data model for persistent storage
  - Save dialog with custom naming
  - History UI with saved comparison management
  - Quick preset buttons for common time periods
  - Cross-platform storage abstraction

#### Phase 2: Critical Bug Resolution (COMPLETED âœ…)
- **Save Functionality Crisis**: Discovered save button completely non-functional
- **App Stability Issues**: Fixed 316+ VS Code problems causing app crashes
- **Code Deduplication**: Removed 1,100+ duplicate lines from dashboard_screen.dart (5,129 â†’ ~4,200 lines)
- **Cross-Platform Storage**: Replaced SharedPreferences with custom `ComparisonStorage` system using:
  - `WebStorage` class for web (dart:html localStorage)
  - SharedPreferences fallback for mobile platforms
  - Proper kIsWeb detection for platform routing

#### Phase 3: Comparison Dialog Restoration (COMPLETED âœ…)
- **Critical Error**: AI assistant accidentally replaced user's beautiful comparison dialog with inferior implementation
- **Root Cause**: When fixing save connectivity, completely overwrote working UI instead of making targeted fix
- **Resolution**: Restored original implementation from `dashboard_screen.dart.backup`
- **Lessons Learned**: Always preserve working UI when making functional fixes

### Current Technical Stack

#### Core Dependencies
```yaml
flutter: 3.35.5
riverpod: ^2.5.1
hive: ^2.2.3
shared_preferences: ^2.2.2
file_saver: ^0.2.9
universal_html: ^2.2.4
intl: ^0.19.0
```

#### Key Data Models
```dart
// Snapshot comparison data structure
class SnapshotDiff {
  final DateTime from, to;
  final List<BucketDiff> buckets;
  final double assetsFrom, assetsTo;
  final double liabilitiesFrom, liabilitiesTo;
  final double netFrom, netTo, netDelta;
}

// Individual asset bucket comparison
class BucketDiff {
  final String name;
  final double from, to, delta, deltaPct;
}

// Saved comparison bookmark
class SavedComparison {
  final String id, name;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final SnapshotDiff diff;
}
```

#### Storage Architecture
```dart
// Cross-platform storage abstraction
class ComparisonStorage {
  static Future<List<SavedComparison>> getSavedComparisons() async {
    if (kIsWeb) {
      return WebStorage.getSavedComparisons();
    } else {
      // SharedPreferences implementation
    }
  }
}

// Web-specific implementation
class WebStorage {
  static const String _storageKey = 'saved_comparisons';
  // Uses dart:html window.localStorage
}
```

### File Structure & Key Components

#### Primary Files
- **`lib/features/dashboard/dashboard_screen.dart`** (4,200+ lines)
  - Main dashboard with snapshot management
  - Comparison functionality with beautiful UI
  - Export capabilities (CSV, PDF)
  - Cross-platform storage integration
  
- **`lib/utils/comparison_storage.dart`**
  - Cross-platform storage abstraction
  - JSON serialization/deserialization
  
- **`lib/utils/web_storage.dart`**
  - Web-specific localStorage implementation
  - Fallback compatibility for mobile

#### Backup Files (CRITICAL)
- **`dashboard_screen.dart.backup`** - Contains user's original beautiful comparison UI
- **`dashboard_screen_backup.dart`** - Additional backup copy

### Current App State

#### Functional Features âœ…
- **Snapshot Creation**: Full CRUD operations with validation
- **Account Management**: Assets and liabilities tracking
- **Comparison System**: 
  - Beautiful dialog with professional layout
  - Asset breakdown table with From/To/Change columns
  - Net worth summary with color-coded changes
  - Export buttons (CSV, PDF Pro)
  - Working save functionality with cross-platform storage
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab bar with Dashboard/Accounts/Debts/Settings
- **Data Persistence**: Hive database with proper web compatibility

#### Database Schema
```
Hive Object Stores:
- accounts: Asset account data
- liabilities: Debt/liability tracking  
- settings: User preferences
- snapshots: Net worth snapshots with timestamps
- actioncards: Dashboard action items
```

#### Running Configuration
- **Web URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:64719/g9TCrerGwqo=` (or similar dynamic port)
- **Chrome DevTools**: Available for debugging
- **Hot Reload**: Functional for development

### Critical Implementation Details

#### Comparison Dialog Features
User's original beautiful implementation includes:
- **Professional header** with date range and time context
- **Net Worth summary box** with highlighted container
- **Asset Changes section** with proper typography
- **Scrollable content** for multiple asset classes
- **Assets Total and Liabilities** with bold formatting and color coding
- **Sticky footer** with net summary and action buttons
- **Export functionality** (CSV working, PDF marked as Pro feature)
- **Proper Material Design** theming and spacing

#### Save Functionality Flow
1. User clicks Save button in comparison dialog
2. `_saveComparison(SnapshotDiff diff)` called
3. `_showSaveComparisonDialog()` presents naming interface
4. User enters custom name (default: "MMM d, yyyy to MMM d, yyyy")
5. `ComparisonStorage.addSavedComparison()` persists to storage
6. Cross-platform routing: Webâ†’localStorage, Mobileâ†’SharedPreferences
7. Success feedback via SnackBar

#### Debug Infrastructure
Comprehensive logging throughout save flow:
```dart
print('ðŸ”´ Save button clicked!');
print('ðŸ’¾ Saving comparison: $name');
print('âœ… Comparison saved successfully');
```

### Known Issues & Limitations

#### Resolved Issues âœ…
- ~~Save button non-functional~~ â†’ Fixed with cross-platform storage
- ~~App compilation errors~~ â†’ Resolved via code deduplication
- ~~RenderFlex overflow crashes~~ â†’ Fixed UI layout issues
- ~~Comparison dialog missing~~ â†’ Restored from backup
- ~~SharedPreferences web incompatibility~~ â†’ Implemented WebStorage

#### Current Status
- **No compilation errors** in VS Code
- **App running successfully** in Chrome
- **All core functionality operational**
- **Beautiful UI preserved** and working
- **Save system fully functional** with cross-platform support

### Development Best Practices

#### For Future AI Assistants
1. **NEVER replace working UI** - always make targeted fixes
2. **Check backup files** before major changes (`*.backup`, `*_backup.dart`)
3. **Preserve user's design choices** - they spent time perfecting the UI
4. **Use cross-platform storage** - Web requires different approach than mobile
5. **Test compilation** after every change with `flutter run -d chrome`
6. **Maintain debug logging** for complex save/load operations

#### File Safety Protocol
```bash
# Always backup before major changes
Copy-Item "lib\features\dashboard\dashboard_screen.dart" "lib\features\dashboard\dashboard_screen.dart.backup" -Force

# Restore if changes break functionality  
Copy-Item "lib\features\dashboard\dashboard_screen.dart.backup" "lib\features\dashboard\dashboard_screen.dart" -Force
```

### Testing Verification Steps

To validate current functionality:
1. **Launch app**: `flutter run -d chrome`
2. **Create snapshots**: Add 2+ snapshots with different values
3. **Test comparison**: Click Compare â†’ Select two different snapshots
4. **Verify UI**: Should see beautiful dialog with Asset Changes, totals, export buttons
5. **Test save**: Click Save â†’ Enter name â†’ Verify success message
6. **Check persistence**: Restart app â†’ Verify saved comparisons available

### Export Capabilities
