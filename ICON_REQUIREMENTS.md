## üöÄ Quick Start: Using Placeholder

For now, I can create simple text-based placeholders. To use real icons:

1. **Create or commission your icons** (Canva, Figma, hire designer)
2. **Export as PNG** at the sizes above
3. **Place in** `assets/icons/` folder
4. **Run commands**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
   flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
   ```

## üîß After Adding Your Icons

Once you have the PNG files:
1. Save them to `assets/icons/`
2. Run the generation commands above
3. Rebuild the app
4. Your icon appears on home screen!
5. Splash screen shows on launch!

## üìê Current Colors in Your App

- **Primary**: Teal/Blue (#00ACC1, #0097A7)
- **Background**: Dark (#1a1a1a, #121212)
- **Accent**: Green (success), Red (warning)

Match your icon to these colors for consistency!
