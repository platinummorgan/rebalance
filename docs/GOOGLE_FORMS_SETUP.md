## Tips & Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Check responses regularly (daily during launch week)
- Respond to critical bugs quickly
- Thank users for detailed feedback
- Close/resolve issues when fixed
- Create labels/tags in sheets to organize responses

### ‚ùå Don't:
- Make too many fields required (users will abandon)
- Ask for sensitive personal information
- Leave responses unread for weeks
- Share the form publicly outside the app (spam risk)

### Privacy Note:
- Google Forms are anonymous by default
- Only collect email if user provides it voluntarily
- Don't share responses with third parties
- Consider adding a privacy note in form descriptions

## Example Form Links (for testing)

You can test your forms before adding them to the app:
1. Open the form link in your browser
2. Submit a test response
3. Check that it appears in the Responses tab
4. Verify the confirmation message shows correctly

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Could not open feedback form" error:**
- Make sure the form link is set to "Anyone with the link can respond"
- Check that you shortened the URL in Google Forms
- Verify the URL is pasted correctly in routes.dart (no extra spaces)

**Form not opening in browser:**
- Check internet connection
- Try opening the form URL directly in Chrome
- Make sure `url_launcher` package is installed

**Responses not showing:**
- Check spam/junk folder if using email notifications
- Open the form and click "Responses" tab
- Link the form to Google Sheets for easier tracking

---

## Future Enhancements

Once you have more users, consider:
1. **GitHub Issues** - For public bug tracking
2. **Discord Server** - For community support
3. **Dedicated Support Email** - With professional domain
4. **In-App Chat** - Using services like Intercom or Crisp
5. **Analytics Integration** - Track which bugs are most common

For now, Google Forms is perfect for launch! üöÄ
