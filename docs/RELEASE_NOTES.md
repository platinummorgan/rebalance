## Tips for Writing Good Release Notes

### ‚úÖ Do:
- **Lead with benefits**: "Track your progress" not "Added tracking feature"
- **Be specific**: "Fixed payment dialog overflow" not "Fixed bugs"

- **Keep it short**: 500 characters max for Play Store
- **Group logically**: New features ‚Üí Improvements ‚Üí Fixes
- **Show value**: Explain WHY users should care

### ‚ùå Don't:
- Use technical jargon ("Refactored provider architecture")
- List internal changes users don't see
- Be vague ("Various improvements")
- Write essays (keep it scannable)
- Forget to proofread

---

## Google Play Store Character Limits

- **Title**: 50 characters
- **Short Description**: 80 characters
- **Full Description**: 4000 characters
