## Phase 2: Create Signing Key (15 minutes)

### Why You Need This
Google requires signed APKs. The signing key proves you're the legitimate developer.

### Step 1: Create Keystore File

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd D:\Dev\wealth_dial

# Create keystore (answer all prompts)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore rebalance-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias rebalance
```

**Prompts you'll see**:
```
Enter keystore password: [CREATE STRONG PASSWORD]
Re-enter password: [REPEAT]
What is your first and last name? [Your name]
What is the name of your organizational unit? [Your name or "Rebalance"]
What is the name of your organization? [Your name or "Rebalance"]
What is the name of your City or Locality? [Your city]
What is the name of your State or Province? [Your state]
What is the two-letter country code? [US]
Is CN=... correct? [yes]
```

**CRITICAL**: Store these securely:
```
Keystore Password: _______________
Key Password: _______________
Alias: rebalance
File Location: D:\Dev\wealth_dial\rebalance-release-key.jks
```

### Step 2: Create key.properties File

Create `android/key.properties`:

```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=rebalance
storeFile=D:/Dev/wealth_dial/rebalance-release-key.jks
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Add to `.gitignore`:
```
# In .gitignore
android/key.properties
*.jks
```

### Step 3: Update android/app/build.gradle

Find the `android {` block and add BEFORE it:

```gradle
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}
```

Inside `android { buildTypes {` block, replace `release {` section:

```gradle
release {
    signingConfig signingConfigs.release
    minifyEnabled true
    shrinkResources true
}
```

Add BEFORE `buildTypes {`:

```gradle
signingConfigs {
    release {
        keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
        keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
        storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
        storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
    }
}
```
