# Wealth Dial Privacy Policy

*Last updated: September 29, 2025*

## Introduction

Wealth Dial is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our app handles your information.

## Data Collection

**We collect NO personal data.**

Wealth Dial is designed with privacy as the foundation:

- No user accounts or sign-up required
- No data transmitted to external servers
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry
- No advertisements or third-party integrations
- No access to contacts, location, or other device data

## Data Storage

All your financial data is stored locally on your device using encrypted storage:

- Account balances and allocation information
- Liability and debt details
- Your personal settings and preferences
- Historical snapshots for trend analysis

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.

## Data Security

Your data is protected by:

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard AES encryption
- **Local Storage**: Data is stored only on your device in secure, sandboxed storage
- **No Network Access**: The app does not transmit any personal or financial data over the internet
- **Optional Biometric Lock**: Pro users can enable fingerprint/face unlock for additional security

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties for any reason. Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing to share.

## Optional Features

### Pro Features
If you purchase Pro features through app stores, the transaction is handled by Apple App Store or Google Play Store according to their privacy policies. We receive only anonymized purchase confirmations.

### Export Functionality
You can optionally export your data:
- **CSV Export**: Creates anonymized summaries of your account balances
- **Encrypted Backup**: Creates a password-protected backup file that only you can decrypt

Both exports are generated locally and shared only if you choose to do so.

## Third-Party Services

The app may open external links (such as financial education resources) in your device's browser. These external websites have their own privacy policies.

## Children's Privacy

Wealth Dial is not designed for or targeted at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app and on this page with a new "last updated" date.

## Summary
