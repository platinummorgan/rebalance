# Pro Features Restructure: Outcome-Driven Monetization

## üéØ Core Problem

**Current paywall**: Feature-focused ("dark mode", "PDF export", "advanced features")
**New approach**: Outcome-focused ("Save $3,412 on debt", "Cut concentration risk", "86% chance to hit goals")

People pay for **results**, not features.

---

## üÜì Move to Free Tier (Retention Drivers)

These don't sell subscriptions but increase daily engagement and trust:

### 1. Dark Mode
- **Why free**: Standard expectation, not a differentiator
- **Benefit**: Increases daily usage, improves retention
- **Implementation**: Remove `isPro` check from dark mode toggle

### 2. Basic Export
- **What's free**: CSV export of accounts/liabilities
- **Why free**: Builds trust, enables backup, doesn't provide strategic value
- **What stays Pro**: Advanced exports (PDF reports with recommendations, tax-loss harvesting reports)

### 3. Basic Alerts
- **What's free**: Simple notifications ("payment due tomorrow", "drift > 10%")
- **Why free**: Keeps users engaged, prevents churn
- **What stays Pro**: Custom alerts with dollar-impact context

**Result**: Free users stay engaged ‚Üí trust builds ‚Üí convert to Pro when they need outcomes
