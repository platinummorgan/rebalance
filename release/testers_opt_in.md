Day-7 reminder (copy/paste)

Subject: Quick reminder — Wealth Dial test (day 7)

Hi — quick reminder to stay opted-in for the Wealth Dial closed test. You’re halfway through the 14-day requirement. If you haven’t installed or opened the app this week, please try the checklist from the original message for 10–15 minutes.

Thanks again!


Troubleshooting (copy/paste)

If the purchase or install doesn’t work:
- Confirm the tester Google account is active on the device (Play Store profile > check account).
- Clear Play Store cache: Settings → Apps → Google Play Store → Storage → Clear cache.
- Make sure the app was installed from the Play Store test link (not sideloaded).
- If the purchase still fails, try rebooting the device.

If testers report persistent problems, gather: device model, Android version, Play Store account email, and a screenshot of the Play error. Paste that in replies.
