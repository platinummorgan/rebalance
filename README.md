## Data Models

### Core Entities
```dart
// Investment accounts with allocation breakdown
Account {
  String id, name, kind;
  double balance;
  double pctCash, pctBonds, pctUsEq, pctIntlEq, pctRealEstate, pctAlt;
  double employerStockPct; // For concentration risk
}

// Debts and liabilities  
Liability {
  String id, name, kind;
  double balance, apr, minPayment;
  double? creditLimit; // For utilization calculation
}

// User preferences and targets
Settings {
  RiskBand riskBand; // Conservative, Balanced, Growth
  double monthlyEssentials; // For liquidity calculation
  double driftThresholdPct; // Rebalancing sensitivity
  double usEquityTargetPct; // Home bias target
}
```

## Calculation Engine

### Diversification Factors

1. **Liquidity (Emergency Fund)**
   - Formula: `(Cash + 0.5×Bonds) / monthlyEssentials`
   - Bands: Red <1mo, Yellow 1-3mo, Green 3-6mo, Blue >6mo

2. **Concentration (Risk Management)** 
   - Formula: `max(allocationBuckets) or employerStockPct`
   - Bands: Red >20%, Yellow 10-20%, Green <10%

3. **Home Bias (Geographic Diversification)**
   - Formula: `intlEquityPct within totalEquity`
   - Target: 20% international (adjustable)

4. **Fixed Income (Risk-Appropriate Bonds)**
   - Targets: Conservative 60%, Balanced 40%, Growth 20%
   - Based on investable assets (excludes cash/RE)

5. **Debt Load (Sustainability)**
   - Flags: Revolving debt >20% APR, credit util >90%
   - Considers mortgage-to-net-worth ratio

### Action Card Logic
- **Priority Order**: High APR debt → Liquidity → Concentration → Bonds → Home bias
- **Monthly Targets**: 6-month glide path for rebalancing suggestions
- **Specific Guidance**: Dollar amounts, not just percentages

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
# All tests
flutter test

# Specific test file

## Building for Release

### Generate Release Bundle
```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Build signed release
flutter build appbundle --release --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/symbols/

# Output: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### Keystore Setup
```bash
# Generate keystore (one-time)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/wealth-dial-key.jks \
